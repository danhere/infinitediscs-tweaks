# Infinite Discs: CSS Tweaks
I wrote some CSS to improve the disc buying selection modal on InfiniteDiscs.com.

You'll need something like [Stylus for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) to add these styles.

_Disclaimer: These are ONLY minor cosmetic changes. I'm not affiliated with Infinite Discs._
